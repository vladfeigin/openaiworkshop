You have a team of analysts that are familiar with no-code and SQL analytical tools that will be consuming the data. The data volume is under 100GB. What is the best solution for your team?\\n\\nHelpful Answer: The best solution for your team would be to use a Power BI datamart. The datamart will allow for a no-code experience to build the capability fast. Queries can be executed via Power BI and T-SQL, while also allowing any Spark users in the organization to access the data as well. Additionally, the team of analysts that are familiar with no-code and SQL analytical tools will be able to consume the data easily. \\n\\nScenario 4\\n\\nYou are a data engineer that is working for a large company.
