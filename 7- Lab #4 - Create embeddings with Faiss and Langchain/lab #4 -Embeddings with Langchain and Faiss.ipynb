You should choose a data warehouse if you have structured data and you only have SQL skills. \\n\\nQuestion: What did Ash decide to use, and why?\\nHelpful Answer: Ash decided to use a Power BI datamart, because they didn't have enough skills to use a lakehouse or data warehouse, and they needed a self-service, no-code capability. Also, their data volume was under 100 GB. They knew that their team was familiar with Power BI and Microsoft Office, and they already had a Premium capacity subscription. The primary consumers of their data were analysts, familiar with no-code and SQL analytical tools. \\n\\nQuestion: What is a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric?\\nHelpful Answer: A lakehouse is a place to store and model unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, where you can use a mix of SQL and Spark skills. It allows the data engineering team to use their diverse skills against the data, while allowing the team members who are highly skilled in T-SQL to consume the data. It uses Delta to store data, which allows for interaction with a similar SQL syntax. \\n\\n\"}"

Using a data warehouse allows the team to interact primarily with T-SQL, while also allowing any Spark users in the organization to access the data.\\n<|im_end|>'}"
